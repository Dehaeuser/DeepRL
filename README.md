# Deep RL
Repository for the course Deep reinforcement learning at University of Osnabrueck in the winter term 2020/2021.
Repository contains solutions to the homework assignments and the final project.
All homeworks are solved using the [ReAlly framework](https://github.com/geronimocharlie/ReAllY) by Charlie Lange.

### Homework 1
Solving a gridworld environment using Watkins Q-Learning.

### Homework 2
Solving the OpenAI gym environment [CartPole-v0](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/) using 
a Vanilla-DQN approach.

### Homework 3
Solving the OpenAI gym environment [LunarLanderContinuous-v2](https://gym.openai.com/envs/LunarLanderContinuous-v2/) using a Policy Gradient Algorithm. Implemented in two ways: 1. Actor only model, 2. Advantage Actor-Critic model

### Final Project
Reimplementing a Language Emergence Agent as published in [Mordatch & Abbeel (2018)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.04908.pdf).
